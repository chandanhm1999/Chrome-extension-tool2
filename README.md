## To create a Chrome extension tool, you'll need to use the following tech stack:

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: These are the foundational web development technologies that will allow you to create the interface and functionality of your extension.

Chrome Extension APIs: These are the APIs provided by Google that allow you to interact with the Chrome browser and its various features, such as tabs, bookmarks, and the address bar.

Backend technologies (optional): Depending on the functionality you want to provide, you may need to use backend technologies like Node.js or Python to perform server-side tasks.

## To deploy your Chrome extension tool, you'll need to follow these steps:

Create a developer account on the Chrome Web Store: You'll need to create a developer account on the Chrome Web Store in order to publish your extension. This involves paying a one-time registration fee of $5.

Package your extension: You'll need to package your extension as a ZIP file, which includes all the necessary code and assets. You can do this from within the Chrome Developer Dashboard.

Upload your extension: Once you've packaged your extension, you can upload it to the Chrome Web Store from within the Developer Dashboard. You'll need to provide a description, screenshots, and other information about your extension.

Publish your extension: After you've uploaded your extension, it will go through a review process to ensure it meets Google's policies and guidelines. Once it's been approved, you can publish it to the Chrome Web Store for users to install and use.
